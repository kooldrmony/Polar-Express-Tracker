# Polar Express Train-Scheduler

This project was created to showcase my abilities to incorporate a fun, friendly User Interface with the use of a Firebase backend database. 
The page allows the user to add a new arrival and departure city as well as a start time for the train. When the user inputs all the fields and submits it, the information is then logged into the table which displays all of the information entered. 

## How to Access

## Purpose

This application was designed to showcase my ability to incorporate a Firebase Database that allowed user input information to be stored. It also showcases the use of CSS and JavaScript abilities. 

## Future Developement

Future development of this project is to reduce the amount of information shown and only show the previous five entries as well as reload the page automatically to keep the arrival times up to date.
